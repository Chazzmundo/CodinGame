# CodinGame

In this repository, you can find some helpers to make life a little easier when working with the platform.

Each of them are designed to be as simple as possible to integrate into your project (each will have its own ReadMe file with a step-by-step guide on how to utilise it)

## Helpers

### InputHelper

A Quality of Life (QOL) improvement designed to drastically reduce the amount of tedious and repetitive manual input you need to do for inputting the test data each time you run your script.
